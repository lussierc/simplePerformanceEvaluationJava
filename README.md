# simplePerformanceExperimentsJava
A Java program that does performance analyses for user-selected computations and doubling-experiment lengths. After a certain amount of time, currently 5 minutes (this may be updated to be user-selected), the experiment will stop.

## About This Project
This Java project was created by 3 Allegheny College students for a final project for the Spring 2018 semester (in CMPSC112). As such there are some files relating to the assignment, such as the files located in the writing file and some files say "lab" in them. Since this project was submitted in May, except for some simple writing, this program will likely not be updated again. All of the files commits were copied over from the original GitHub classroom repository, but the issues in the issue tracker unfortunately did not properly copy over.

## Running The Project
This project uses gradle. Here are some important commands that can be used in terminal to use the project:
* `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
* `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line
