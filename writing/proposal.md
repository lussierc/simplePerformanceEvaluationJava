# Performance Evaluations Based On User Choices

## Abstract

This project will perform performance evaluations of specific computational
functions and data types. It will utilize generics, doubling experiments, and more
to gather data. Data will be stored in a resultsTable and the user can choose to
output either as the whole resultsTable or specific results. This will allow user
to customize what types of performance evaluations they want to complete.

## Description of the main idea

This project will encompass many of the different topics that were discussed in
CMPSC 112 throughout the semester. These ideas would include data types, generics,
computational functions, doubling experiments, and more, all coming together to
perform performance evaluations. The program would allow the user to choose the
computational functions and data types they want to perform performance evaluations
on. They would input their choices and the program will begin running by using
campaigns and doubling experiments. A timing experiment will then be performed to
see how long it takes to run the computational method for the chosen data type.
The results from the timing experiment will be stored in a resultsTable allowing
for a easy performance evaluation. After this, the user can choose between
outputting the whole resultsTable or outputting specific results to view. This
program would allow users to simply perform performance evaluations of specific
computational functions and data types, by use of robust, adaptable, and reusable
code.

## Tentative Task List

1. Create test cases to make sure the computational
2. Create the computational functions classes.
3. Create a campaign and a runCampaign.
4. Create a doubling experiment.
5. Create a resultsTable to store data.
6. Add way for user to input what computation function and what data type they
want specifically.
7. Implement code that has runs the selected computational function and data
type.
8. Allow the user to what information they want to be outputted. They can chose
between outputting the whole resultsTable or specific rounds of the doubling
experiment.
9. Complete one more of the optional tasks listed below if time allots.
   * Create a GUI.
   * Add a save feature for users to save the output from the program.

## Team Plan

To complete the project in the allotted amount of time a plan is necessary for
success. Our plan will consist of assigning group members specific tasks from
the task list. In order to let other team members know what needs to be done or
if there seems to be errors, the Issues tool in GitHub will be used. Similarly,
a group chat in Slack will be used for team members to coordinate actions and
meeting times to work on the project. The team will complete the first 8 tasks
in time for the April 24th status update and project demonstration. The remaining
time before the final project is due on May 4th will be used to fine tune writing
responses and project code. In addition, if there is time left over extra things
such as the optional tasks can be added and completed to the program. By
coordinating our actions and communicating, the team should be able to complete
the required deliverables in time for their respective due dates.
