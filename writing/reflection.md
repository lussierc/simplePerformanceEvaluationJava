# Proposal by Team 3 (Lancaster Wu, Devin Ho, and Christian Lussier)

This lab required me to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
Please review the Laboratory Assignment Sheet and add the required details to
this paragraph.

The second paragraph will discuss the first team member's insights (Devin).

In our group project, I was in charge of implementing the test cases for
different computational methods as well as debugging. I had to add in the
recursivefibonacci, iterativeFibonacci, and recursiveFibonacciHashMap test
cases. They allowed us to check for correctness in our code which establishes a
confidence in our coding as well. Gradle will then build our program and
display if the test cases passed or not. Afterwards, debugging was a role in
which I had to figure out why some implementations of our program was not
implemented correctly. This may be due to syntax or some other similar error.
Lastly, I was able to correct the indenting and spacing in our code in order to
promote clarity and visibility.

The fourth paragraph will discuss the third team member's insights.

If needed, the fifth paragraph will discuss the third team member's insights.
