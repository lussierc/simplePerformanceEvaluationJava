# Proposal by Team 3 (Lancaster Wu, Devin Ho, and Christian Lussier)

This lab required me to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
Please review the Laboratory Assignment Sheet and add the required details to
this paragraph.

The second paragraph will discuss the first team member's insights.

The third paragraph will discuss the second team member's (Devin) insights. I
was responsible for adding the FibonacciRecursive computation into the program.
The user is asked to input numbers from 0 to 9 to either choose a type of
computation or to end the program. After that, the user is asked to input the
number of rounds they want the program to run. If the program takes too much
time to run the requested amount of rounds, the program will automatically stop
after 5 minutes. The output displays a results table with the size, timing, and
number ratio. The challenges included implementing the different terminal
colors and canceling feature.

The fourth paragraph will discuss the third team member's insights.

If needed, the fifth paragraph will discuss the third team member's insights.
